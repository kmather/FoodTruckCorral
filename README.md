FoodTruckCorral
===============

I chose the Food Trucks project for this coding challenge. The project was something I'd love to see locally. Raleigh-Durham has dozens of food trucks but no reliable way to find food trucks. The twitter feeds and websites are somewhat inaccurate.

I wrote both a back-end and a very light front-end for this project. The back-end is a WCF REST Service hosted on Microsoft Azure. One of my previous roles was in a startup company that commoditized Web services.  When Microsoft WCF rolled around we weren't able to adapt it because it broke a lot of our Gateway infrastructure. I never got a chance to try it, and I've never used Azure before.. the process of hosting it was surprisingly smooth!

On the front-end, I have a broad but shallow depth of experience. I like to build toward usability and simplicity but feel like I'm missing a few things. I'm still coming up to speed with best practices, and have a little experience with IIFEs and creating modules, but had to settle after some issues.

There's a lot of tradeoffs on the front-end. I chose the Google map mashup, along with a list of data and some presets. The map is a nice way of visualizing nearby trucks and the drag-and-drop is nice, but is less elegant for mobile devices. Dragging, clicking, and zooming on a map is a bit more difficult on-the-go, and a lot more care needs to go into increasing the usability. 

I'd love to spend more time looking at the front-end, and seeing what's practical and what isn't. Another thing that would help is having experience living in San Francisco - I am taking a lot of wild guesses at what users may want, or how they'd use it, and guesswork tends to lead to shaky user experience.
